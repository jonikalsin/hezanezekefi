He played and coached Division I football. He was an Auburn tight end and a Vanderbilt graduate coach.&nbsp;The father-son team often discusses football.&nbsp;Todd taught Jackson how to play the game at a high level and is one of Jackson’s main influencers outside of his coaching staff.

He enjoys being able to call plays, get the offense set, and perform well under pressure.</p><p>In his football career, his leadership qualities and physical characteristics were his most valuable assets. Jackson led his St. Paul’s Middle School team to two consecutive district titles.&nbsp;They went undefeated in 2014 and finished with a 6-2 record in 2015. Jackson had a 700-yard throwing average, nine touchdowns, and two interceptions for the season.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmpubqLyvecGuqaSgkaHBpr6Mmp6eZZikxG67y51koqtdnbJuw8ikoGaZnpl6sa3RnqWtq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jim-tom.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jim Tom Wikipedia, Wiki, Hedrick Obituary, Death, Passed Away, Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gianni-decenzo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gianni Decenzo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amani-toomer.html>Amani Toomer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./giovanni-reyna.html>Giovanni Reyna</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-bentlee-sanders-being-on-the-mid-season-all-american-team-is-going-to-kickstart-his-season-with-confidence.html>How Bentlee Sanders being on the Mid-Season All American team is going to kickstart his season with</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Kyrie - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dejah-lanay.html>Dejah Lanay- Age, Net Worth, Height, Boyfriend, Career, Ethnicity</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
