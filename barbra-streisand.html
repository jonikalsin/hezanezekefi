They use metaphors such as a Black Widow spider, a praying mantis, a hornet, and a bald-headed eagle to convey their message. They suggest that men may have the muscle, but women have the hustle. They argue that even the strongest and most regal men need a woman to keep them fed. But, when it comes to mating, the tables turn, and it is men who are often left wanting.</p><br><p>The Queen Bee is a reference to a woman who is wealthy, powerful, and sought-after by men. The song implies that while men may think they want to be with a woman of this caliber, they will ultimately end up being devoured by her. The Oréos sing, "Nothing she'll give you is gonna outlive you, but the queen bee's never gonna be alone." This line suggests that while men may be attracted to powerful women, they will always come second to her needs.</p><br><p>The song also suggests that men should be wary of the women they pursue. The Oréos use the metaphor of a spider wrapping up its prey to warn men not to get too close to dangerous women. They argue that men should not be seduced by a woman's beauty or wealth but should consider the risks they face by pursuing her. In conclusion, "Queen Bee" is a cautionary tale for young men, warning them not to be blinded by a woman's beauty or wealth and to choose a partner wisely.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Will you welcome please: The Oreo's</u><br>Introducing The Oreo's to the audience.</p><br><p><u>The Black Black Widow is sittin' in the middle Of the web it's the fly she seeks (boom boom)</u><br>The Black Widow is always waiting for its prey.</p><br><p><u>You may be her lover but you never will recover Cuz she ain't had a bite for weeks (boom boom)</u><br>Even if you are in love with the Black Widow, you'll still be her next meal.</p><br><p><u>You think you're the same cuz you got the same name But the widow has a mobile home (boom boom)</u><br>The Black Widow can always move to a new location while you stay the same.</p><br><p><u>Remember what I told you She's got eight arms to hold ya And she 's never gonna let you roam (boom boom)</u><br>The Black Widow has plenty of legs to hold onto its prey and never let go.</p><br><p><u>She'll tuck you into bed and truck on your head Then she'll wrap you as a midnight snack.</u><br>The Black Widow's bites will paralyze you, and she will consume you when you are unable to escape.</p><br><p><u>So if you see a spider Don't you sidle up beside her Why you think the widow's wearing black?</u><br>Don't get too close to spiders, especially the Black Widow, because it's a fatal mistake.</p><br><p><u>The Queen bee baby Pray that you may be left on your own Uh huh Nothing she'll give you is gonna out live you Oh oh oh But the queen bee's never gonna be alone Uh huh</u><br>The Queen Bee is powerful and always in control while her workers' lives are short and disposable.</p><br><p><u>Long before Atlantis there has been a praying mantis And you know why he's on his knees</u><br>The praying mantis always bows down before the females when attempting to mate.</p><br><p><u>He may have religion But he's just a sittin pigeon If a woman even starts to tease</u><br>The praying mantis is vulnerable to the females' teasing, and he cannot resist their charm.</p><br><p><u>He won't even quibble if she has a little nibble On his neck what a way to go</u><br>The praying mantis doesn't mind being bitten by the female during mating, even though he will die soon after.</p><br><p><u>Now you've gone and torn it!
