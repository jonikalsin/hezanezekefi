He was born on 31st May 2000 in Argyle, Texas, United States of America. His zodiac sign is Gemini and he is a Christian. He was born to his parents, Sean Payton and Beth Shuey, who were still married at the time of his birth but are now divorced. Connor is an American citizen and belongs to the Caucasian ethnic group.</p><p>He is the second child of two children born to the famous retired coach of the New Orleans Saints and his now ex-wife, Beth Sheuy. The couple had their first child, a daughter named Meghan on 21st March 1997. Meghan is roughly three years older than her brother, Connor, and works as a football journalist. Connor has a good relationship with his sister and they both have both followed in their father’s footsteps careerwise.</p><p>Connor spent most of her early years in Texas and a brief time in Louisiana. The then family of four lived in Dallas until Connor was about 6 when they moved to Mandeville, Louisiana. While his father, Sean, is a famous figure in the NFL, Connor’s mother, Beth, only made it to the limelight as a result of her marriage to Sean. She is an Indiana native and worked as a salesperson in Indianapolis before she met her husband.</p><h3><strong>Educational Background</strong></h3><p>Connor Payton attended Liberty Christian School in Argyle, Texas. He played for Liberty Christian Warriors and also played basketball for the Black Bears Club. Going by his Facebook profile, Connor is currently studying at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, United States, where he also lives.</p><p>He has been a student of the university since 2019 and is slated to graduate in 2023, although the course he is studying is not known to the public. Connor is a huge fan of TCU Horned Frogs, having studied in Texas.</p><h2><strong>Connor was 14 Years Old When His Parents Divorced</strong></h2><p>Connor was 12 years old when when his parents, Sean Payton and Beth Sheuy, separated in 2012 just before their 20th wedding anniversary. This was after almost 20 years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized two years later, in 2014. The ex-couple met in the late 1980s and tied the knot in July 1992.</p><p>Following the divorce, they got joint custody of their two children, but Beth later filed for primary custody, which she subsequently got. Connor and her sister started living with their mom but that did not deter them from establishing a cordial relationship with their father. Sean did and has continued to do his best to be a present father to his children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Connor-Payton-and-his-parents-and-sister-Meghna.png><p>Meanwhile, the ex-couple has moved on to new marriages. While Sean Payton remarried Skylene Montgomery on 18th June 2021, Beth remarried Jamie McGuire on 20th September 2020. From her mother’s second marriage, Connor inherited two half-sisters, Maggie and Molly, who are his stepfather’s daughters from his previous marriage.</p><h2><strong>Sean Payton’s Son, Connor, is Following in His Footsteps</strong></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Connor Payton played football for Liberty Christian Warriors when he was attending Liberty Christian Schools. He also played basketball for the Black Bears club. Although he is still a student, Connor aspires to become a professional player in the NFL and work in an NFL front office. According to reports, he is currently working at the Saints training camp in the Saints Scouting Department.</p><p>Meanwhile, on 28th January 2022, Netflix released the film, Home Team which is about the story of the Payton family, and starred Connor. Particularly, the film follows the true story of Sean Payton returning to his hometown after he was suspended for a year as a coach of the New Orleans Saints in 2012. His team had purposely injured opposite players.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The former NFL coach spent his one year of suspension coaching his son Connor’s middle school football team, Liberty Christian Warriors. Notably, Sean also maximized this opportunity to form a very close bond with his son. Connor has yet to become a professional player, but it is believed that he will sooner or later indeed find success as an athlete just like his father because the apple, they say, does not fall far from the tree.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Is Connor Payton Currently Married or Dating?</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Connor Payton has not publicly disclosed whether he is dating anyone or not.
