Stern made a wager with the actor, adding, “While Freddie had timidly asserted that “definitely it (the marriage) would continue,” he had placed a wager with him.</p><p>In about ten years, you will track me down and say, “Howard, I owe you money.” Sarah and Freddie tied the knot on September 1, 2002, and on the occasion of their 20th wedding anniversary, Sarah posted images from Prinze’s interview with Howard Stern on Instagram, jokingly calling out Stern for questioning Freddie about their marriage all those years ago.</p><p>In addition to the post, Sarah added the identical screenshot to her Instagram story and addressed Howard Stern in the caption:</p><p>“What do you believe?!?! I believe you owe us.”</p><p>Prinze shared Gellar’s articles and remarked hysterically:</p><p>She will always remember.</p><h2>Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. had been friends for three years before they started dating.</h2><p>On September 1, 2002, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. married the wedding in Mexico. This Thursday, in celebration of their 20th wedding anniversary, Gellar posted a stunning picture from their wedding to Instagram with the comment “20.”&nbsp;In 1997, on the set of I Know What You Did Last Summer, Prinze, and Gellar met. They began dating three years later and wed shortly afterward.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-1.jpg alt="Sarah Michelle Gellar" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In a March 2021 interview with People Magazine, Sarah Michelle Gellar described the beginning of their relationship:</p><p>“There have been many meals before. We were meant to go with someone else, but that individual did not show up, so we decided to go anyhow. At supper, there were just two of us catching up. We had a lengthy car trip and a lengthy supper, and events just transpired.”</p><p>Prinze gently added that he did not want to go on another date after that evening. He said:</p><p>“I knew we were going to be married and that I would propose one day. I did not know when or how this would occur.”</p><p>Freddie Prinze Jr. was questioned in a 2020 interview with Entertainment Tonight about his long-lasting marriage to Sarah Michelle Gellar. In response, the Scooby-Doo actor said humorously that the greatest marital advice is to never share a restroom. He quipped:</p><p>“That is my finest recommendation… Never share a restroom… If they quit making you laugh, your future is bleak.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-2.jpg alt="Sarah Michelle Gellar" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The duo often expresses affection for one another on Instagram. Sarah Michelle Gellar sent a touching birthday message to her husband Freddie. She penned:</p><p>“The birthday of @realfreddieprinze is today. This is often where I would make a joke. However, it is also #internationalwomensday, and it makes perfect sense that you share this day, since no male is a greater advocate and friend of women than you. I cannot imagine a finer person with whom to raise a girl or to educate a boy on what it genuinely means to be a decent man. Best wishes on your birthday, FP.”</p><p>The couple has two children: 12-year-old Charlotte Grace and 10-year-old Rocky James.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmarkaeuqXnMopqhnZyhsm6zxKWjmqpdlrulecWrnJ2cmZp6sb7Ip7GeZZ2Wv7O1xJ1kpaGWmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jewelry.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Add a Cute Fashion Element to Your Outfits With the Best Fringe</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./briana-jones.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Briana Jones, Author At All That's Interesting</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amani-toomer.html>Amani Toomer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./giovanni-reyna.html>Giovanni Reyna</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-bentlee-sanders-being-on-the-mid-season-all-american-team-is-going-to-kickstart-his-season-with-confidence.html>How Bentlee Sanders being on the Mid-Season All American team is going to kickstart his season with</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Kyrie - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dejah-lanay.html>Dejah Lanay- Age, Net Worth, Height, Boyfriend, Career, Ethnicity</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
