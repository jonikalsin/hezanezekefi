He was joined by drummer <a href=#>Dave Grohl</a> and bassist <a href=#>Krist Novoselic</a> in Nirvana.</p><p>Cobain was born at Grays Harbor Hospital in Aberdeen, Washington on February 20, 1967, the son of waitress Wendy Elizabeth (née Fradenburg; born 1948) and automotive mechanic Donald Leland Cobain (born 1946). His parents were married on July 31, 1965, in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. His ancestry included Dutch, English, French, German, Irish, and Scottish. His Irish ancestors emigrated from Carrickmore, County Tyrone in 1875. Researchers found that they were shoemakers, originally named “Cobane”, who came from Inishatieve, a townland within Carrickmore. They first settled in Cornwall, Ontario, Canada, and then in Washington. Cobain himself believed his family came from County Cork. His younger sister, Kimberly, was born on April 24, 1970.</p><p>Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967&nbsp;– April 5, 1994) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician, best known as the guitarist and frontman of the rock band Nirvana. Regarded as a Generation X icon, he is considered to be one of the most iconic and influential rock musicians in the history of alternative music.</p><p align=justify>He was raised with a younger sister named Kimberly. He married <a href=#>Courtney Love</a> on February 24, 1992 and he and Love had a daughter together named <a href=#>Frances Bean Cobain</a>.</p><p align=justify>His 1993 album with Nirvana, In Utero, went five-times Platinum, and included the #1 single “Heart-Shaped Box.” He cited novelist <a href=#>William Burroughs</a> as an influence on his writing.</p><p align=justify>Cobain’s family had a musical background. His maternal uncle, Chuck Fradenburg, played in a band called The Beachcombers; his aunt, Mari Earle, played guitar and performed in bands throughout Grays Harbor County; and his great-uncle, Delbert, had a career as an Irish tenor, making an appearance in the 1930 film King of Jazz. Kurt was described as being a happy and excitable child, who also exhibited sensitivity and care. His talent as an artist was evident from an early age, as he would draw his favorite characters from films and cartoons, such as the Creature from the Black Lagoon and Donald Duck, in his bedroom. This enthusiasm was encouraged by his grandmother, Iris Cobain, who was a professional artist.</p><h2>Kurt Cobain Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kurt is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United States.

Such misconduct eventually caused his father and Westeby to take him to a therapist, who concluded that he would benefit from a single family environment. Both sides of the family attempted to bring his parents back together, but to no avail. On June 28, 1979, Cobain’s mother granted full custody to his father. Cobain’s teenage rebellion quickly became overwhelming for his father, who placed his son in the care of family and friends. While living with the born-again Christian family of his friend Jesse Reed, he became a devout Christian and regularly attended church services. He later renounced Christianity, engaging in what was described as “anti-God” rants. The song “Lithium” is about his experience while living with the Reed family. Religion remained an important part of his personal life and beliefs.</p><h2>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h2><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kurt Cobain ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Nirvana occasionally played cover songs by these bands, including Led Zeppelin’s “Heartbreaker,” “Moby Dick” and “Immigrant Song,” Black Sabbath’s “Hand of Doom,” and Kiss’ “Do You Love Me?” and wrote the Incesticide song “Aero Zeppelin” as a tribute to Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. Recollecting touring with his band, Cobain stated, “I used to take a nap in the van and listen to Queen. Over and over again and drain the battery on the van. We’d be stuck with a dead battery because I’d listened to Queen too much”.</p><h2>Who is Kurt Cobain Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Kurt Cobain</strong> married to <strong>Courtney Love </strong>.

Although his father had promised not to remarry, after meeting Jenny Westeby, he did, to Kurt’s dismay. Cobain, his father, Westeby, and her two children, Mindy and James, moved into a new household together. Cobain liked Westeby at first, as she gave him the maternal attention he desired. In January 1979, Westeby gave birth to a boy, Chad Cobain. This new family, which Cobain insisted was not his real one, was in stark contrast to the attention Cobain was used to receiving as an only boy, and he soon began to express resentment toward his stepmother. Cobain’s mother began dating a man who was abusive. Cobain witnessed the domestic violence inflicted upon her, with one incident resulting in her being hospitalized with a broken arm. Wendy steadfastly refused to press charges, remaining completely committed to the relationship.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kurt Cobain height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Kurt <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Punk rock proved to be a profound influence on a teenaged Cobain’s attitude and artistic style. His first punk rock album was Sandinista! by The Clash, but he became a bigger fan of a fellow 1970s British punk band the Sex Pistols, describing them as “one million times more important than the Clash” in his journals. He was introduced to 1980s American hardcore bands like Black Flag, Bad Brains, Millions of Dead Cops and Flipper by Buzz Osborne, lead singer and guitarist of the Melvins and fellow Aberdeen native. Osborne taught Cobain about Punk by loaning him records and old copies of the Detroit-based magazine Creem. The Melvins themselves were an important early musical influence on Cobain, with their heavy, grungey sound mimicked by Nirvana on many songs from Bleach.</p><p align=justify>Throughout most of his life, Cobain suffered from chronic bronchitis and intense physical pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition. His first drug experience was with cannabis in 1980, at age 13. He regularly used the drug during adulthood. Cobain also had a period of consuming “notable” amounts of LSD, as observed by Marander, and was “really into getting fucked up: drugs, acid, any kind of drug”, observed Krist Novoselic; Cobain was also prone to alcoholism and solvent abuse. According to The Telegraph, Cobain had depression. His cousin brought attention to the family history of suicide, mental illness and alcoholism, noting two of her uncles who had died by suicide with guns.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Kurt Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Rock Singer</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Kurt Cobain celebrates birthday on February 20 of every year.</p><p align=justify>The 1980s American alternative rock band Pixies were instrumental in helping an adult Cobain develop his own songwriting style. In a 1992 interview with Melody Maker, Cobain said that hearing their 1988 debut album, Surfer Rosa, “convinced him to abandon his more Black Flag-influenced songwriting in favor of the Iggy Pop/Aerosmith–type songwriting that appeared on Nevermind. In a 1993 interview with Rolling Stone, he said that “Smells Like Teen Spirit” was his attempt at “trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily that I should have been in that band—or at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard”.</p><h3>How old would Kurt Cobain be today?</h3><p>If Kurt Cobain, who died by his own hand over 20 years ago, were alive today, he would be <b>55 years old</b>.</p><h3>Why is Kurt Cobain so famous?</h3><p>Kurt Cobain, in full Kurt Donald Cobain, (born February 20, 1967, Aberdeen, Washington, U.S.—died April 5, 1994, Seattle, Washington), American rock musician who rose to fame as the <b>lead singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter for the seminal grunge band Nirvana</b>.</p><h3>Was Kurt Cobain left handed?</h3><p>Cobain was a <b>right-hander</b> — and why he played guitar with the left is a mystery.</p><h3>What was Kurt Cobain's problem?</h3><p>Cobain’s depression and chronic pain from an undiagnosed stomach condition led him to start using prescription pills and ultimately pick up heroin in 1986, from which he struggled with addiction for years before finally getting help in 1992.</p><h3>Why did Kurt Cobain wear dress?</h3><p>On tour in April 1990, Kurt rocked a floral number for a show at Hampshire College in Amherst. “I like to wear dresses <b>because they’re comfortable</b>,” he would later tell Melody Maker. “There’s nothing more comfortable than a cosy flower pattern.
