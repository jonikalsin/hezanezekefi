Social media users have been quick to theorize that her new track, “The Very First Night” which appeared on&nbsp;Red (Taylor’s Version), may have been inspired by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>. The song, which was co-written by Taylor, <strong>Amund Bjørklund</strong> and <strong>Espen Lind</strong>, is the 29th song on her new album, and one of nine previously unheard tracks released “From the Vault.” Although most of the album, including her hit song <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“All Too Well,”</a> were inspired by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong></a>, the lyrics for “The Very First Night” seemingly make multiple references to the former&nbsp;<strong>One Direction&nbsp;</strong>hitmaker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Taylor-swift-and-harry-styles-embed1.jpg><p data-skm-boomerang-el-3=processed>In the song, Taylor sings, “we were built to fall apart,” which is a lyric from her&nbsp;1989 song, “Out of the Woods,” which was also believed to be about Harry. The track is also believed to be a precursor&nbsp;1989, because of its upbeat, poppy vibe, reminiscent of her following album, which ultimately won a Grammy Award. “It is so Haylor. Sounds way more kiddish and young love to me. Very 1989 reminiscent. Jake songs give me much more mature, serious vibes to me. I picture Harry and Taylor all giddy like this when they first met,” one user wrote on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Reddit.</a></p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-3=processed>As fans would recall, she and Harry dated from late 2012 to early 2013, following her relationship with the&nbsp;Brokeback Mountain&nbsp;actor, which ended in heartbreak. On her new album, she included the full, original version of “All Too Well” — and it’s more than 10 minutes long. In some of the new lyrics, Taylor details what happened when she and Jake broke up, indicating their age difference caused a rift.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Taylor-swift-and-jake-gyllenhaal-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>“You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine, and that made me want to die,” Taylor sings. She also threw some shade at her fellow A-lister for continuing to date younger women after their breakup, later crooning, “I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age.” When Taylor announced she was dropping her version of the 2012 album, she noted,&nbsp;“Like your friend who calls you in the middle of the night going on and on about their ex, I just couldn’t stop writing. This will be the first time you hear all 30 songs that were meant to go on&nbsp;Red.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a> earlier this year, she called&nbsp;Red her only “true” heartbreak album. “I look back on this [Red] as my true breakup album, every other album has flickers of different things. But this was an album that I wrote specifically about pure, absolute, to the core, heartbreak,” she revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5BrZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2ptaZ51Z6psmWWnr%2B0wIynoKCgpGK1or7RsmSsrKmhsrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lana-condor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lana Condor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./oaklands-sweets-ballroom-up-for-sale.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Oakland's Sweet's Ballroom Up For Sale</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amani-toomer.html>Amani Toomer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./giovanni-reyna.html>Giovanni Reyna</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-bentlee-sanders-being-on-the-mid-season-all-american-team-is-going-to-kickstart-his-season-with-confidence.html>How Bentlee Sanders being on the Mid-Season All American team is going to kickstart his season with</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Kyrie - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dejah-lanay.html>Dejah Lanay- Age, Net Worth, Height, Boyfriend, Career, Ethnicity</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
