Then, her career took a flight shortly after her marriage to Bobby. Tanya Deol soon got a lot of B-town biggies to become her clients.

Likewise, it is not hidden that Devendra Ahuja was in a relationship with another woman while still married to his wife. This led to an estrangement between the two. And, after Devendra Ahuja moved into a live-in relationship with his girlfriend, his son accused his father of being biased toward his sister, Tanya, and her husband Bobby Deol. Moreover, this prompted Devendra Ahuja to strike out his son’s name from his Rs. 300 crore property.</p><p>Moreover, the feud took another turn after Devendra Ahuja’s unexpected demise at 74 years of age back in the year 2010. And, his son was not allowed to attend his father’s last rites which were instead performed by Bobby. When Vikram finally managed to attend his father’s condolence meeting at his apartment, he was told by a close relative that it was allegedly Tanya Deol’s idea to keep Vikram out of the whole scene. And, this turn of events has caused incurable bitterness between Tanya and her long-time estranged brother who is rarely seen in public together.</p><h2><span id=Tanya_Deol_8211_Relationship_Status>Tanya Deol – Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Tanya’s husband, <strong>Bobby Deol</strong> was high on fame after the release of his much-acclaimed Barsat in the year 1995. Bobby became popular and a thing among the female fan following. And, it was in the same year that Bobby had gone to dine at his favorite Italian restaurant, Trattoria at Mumbai’s Hotel President. It was the place where Bobby and Tanya met each other for the first time.</p><p>Likewise, after seeing Tanya for the first time, Bobby Deol was completely head over heels for her. He also worked very diligently to get her number. Then they began dating. Moreover, to confess his love to Tanya, Bobby took her back to Trattoria restaurant to propose to which she agreed. Further, Tanya and Bobby tied the knot on 30 May 1996 after almost a year of courtship. Since then, they have been happily married.</p><p>Then, in June 2002, the couple welcomed their first son Aryaman Deol. And, two years later, in November, they welcomed their second son Dharam Deol. His name is after his grandfather Dharmendra.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-92405 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tanya-Deol-Relation.jpg alt="Tanya Deol" width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-92405 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Tanya with her husband, Bobby Deol (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Tanya_Deol_8211_Body_Measurements>Tanya Deol – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Tanya Deol has a <strong>height</strong> of 5 feet 5 inches and her weight is 50 Kg.
