His death was caused by a terrible accident on the job site. He was working on a building site when a beam fell on his head, so the story goes. It made his brain swell up and broke his spinal cord.</p><p>When he got to the ICU on September 1, 2023, he was bleeding badly and his diaphragm was pushing on his lungs. He was given drugs to put him to sleep, but he never woke up.</p><h2>Who is Mike Williams?</h2><p><strong>Mike Williams was an American football player who played for the Buffalo Bills and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</strong> The Buccaneers picked him in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft.</p><p>He was a great player at Syracuse University, where he was picked up. He caught 65 passes for 964 yards and 11 scores in his first season, which was a good sign.</p><p><img alt="Mike Williams Cause of Death" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-83.jpg></p><p>He played for the Buccaneers for four years and for the Bills for one. In 63 games, he caught 223 passes for 3,089 yards and 26 scores. He died on September 12, 2023, when he was 36 years old. After a construction accident left him partly paralyzed, his life support was turned off.</p><h2>Mike Williams Cause of Death</h2><p>Mike Williams, a 36-year-old former NFL wide receiver, died unexpectedly on September 12, 2023. His death shocked both the sports and building industries.</p><p><strong>Williams died on September 12, 2023, because a steel beam that hit him while he was working on a building site hurt his head badly.</strong></p><h2>Mike Williams Was Buffalo Through and Through</h2><p>The death of Mike Williams is a terrible loss for everyone. Except for a short time in the NFL, he has always lived in Buffalo. He was born and went to school in the city. He went to Riverside High. From there, he went to Syracuse, which wasn’t too far away, to play football.</p><p>He was picked up by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2010 NFL Draft and played for them until 2013. Then, in 2014, he went back home to play for the Buffalo Bills.</p><p><img alt="Mike Williams Cause of Death" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-104.jpg></p><p>At the time, it was a rough time for him. He met Doug Marrone again, who had been his boss at Syracuse. During his college football days, however, Mike Williams quit the team after getting in a car crash. This is said to have caused a rift between the two. At first, both men played down the bad feelings from their past relationships, but soon after, things started to get worse.</p><p>There were times when he broke league rules by wearing socks, showed up to the stadium with full pads on, told everyone about his illness before a game, and asked to be traded, just to name a few. At the end of 2014, the Buffalo Bills let him go.</p><p>The NFL banned him in 2015, but they didn’t say why. For the whole year, he was a free agent. Then, in 2016, he joined the Kansas City Chiefs’ practice team. That was the last time he played for the NFL. He had 223 receptions, 3,089 yards, and 26 scores by the end of his football career.</p><p>Even though not much is known about him after that, the most shocking story shows that he worked in construction. Mike Williams may have done more in football than the normal person, but he will always be remembered for his colorful personality and his ties to Buffalo.</p><p>More Related Posts on The Shahab:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>How Did Aaron Bivens Die?
