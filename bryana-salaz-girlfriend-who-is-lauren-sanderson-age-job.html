According to Lauren’s Wikipedia page, they have been in a relationship with Bryana since February 2020.

We&nbsp;all deserve that, but it took me a long time to grow up and face my own internal emotional and mental issues and trauma, to be ready to receive and also reciprocate love in a healthy way,” she told PopBuzz. “I’ve always loved the thrill of love but my “ah-ha” moment was realizing if you actually want something real and long-lasting, [you have to] stop chasing that unpredictable roller coaster and start manifesting someone/somewhere you will feel safe. That’s the real dream—and I finally found it.”</p><p>In August 2020, Lauren released a debut album Midwest Kids Can Make It Big Deluxe with seven tracks. The vulnerable lead track “Frustrated” from the deluxe edition, which was written about Sanderson’s girlfriend, singer-actress Bryana Salaz, shows that beauty can be found even in the darkest corners.</p><p>“Oh man, I was nervous as hell to show her, honestly. My cheeks were all red and sh–. I texted her as soon as I started thinking of the lyrics, just like, “I think I’m about to write a fire song about you right now,” but I wouldn’t let her hear it ‘til we were in person,” talking about Bryana’s reaction after hearing the song, she added. “I picked her up after the studio and we drove around listening to it. We had an emotional little moment, not gonna lie. It was cute.”</p><p>Bryana was born on 25 August 1997, so she is 25 years old.
