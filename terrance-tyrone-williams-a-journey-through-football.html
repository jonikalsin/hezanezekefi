T. White High School where he was a standout wide receiver.</p><p>He transferred to Baylor University, where he played for the Baylor Bears football team from 2008 to 2012.</p><p>&nbsp;He most certainly showcased his talents during his college career - catching 202 passes for 3,334 yards and 27 touchdowns. He led the nation with 1,832 receiving yards in 2012 and unanimously became an All-American that season.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Professional Career</h2><p>Williams opened his journey into the NFL when he was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 3rd round of the 2013 NFL Draft.</p><p>As a rookie, he was a large part of the offense, and finished with 44 receptions, for 736 yards and five touchdowns.
