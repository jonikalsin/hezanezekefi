She has co-hosted the podcast Iconography with Olivia Craighead and has been featured on Comedy Central’s Up Next.</p><p>Edebiri is well-known for her appearances in The Bear (2022–present) and Abbott Elementary (2023–present), as well as her voice work as Missy on Big Mouth (2020–present). Edebiri had roles in Theater Camp and Bottoms in 2023 and he also provided voiceovers for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. The main subject of this post is Ayo Edebiri boyfriend and her relationship. <strong>Do you know who is she dating?</strong> Know all the details below:</p><h2>Who Is Ayo Edebiri Boyfriend?</h2><p>Her Twitter followers recently learned that she has a boyfriend in real life, and the reaction to the revelation has been so shocking that a friend has decided to speak up. Over the course of several years, Ayo has been secretly dating actor and writer Colin Burgess. On Valentine’s Day of 2021, he posted a selfie of the two of them.</p><p>I’ve given it a lot of thought, and I’ve come to the conclusion that my girlfriend Ayo should be my Valentine this year. He captioned the image below:</p><p>“This is a photo of us doing Dr. Jart+ Water Jet Vital Hydra SolutionTM sheet mask.”</p><p><strong>Check out the post below:</strong></p><p>Some fans’ reactions on Twitter to the news that Ayo is actually taken have been somewhat extreme. Actor Joel Kim Booster, who is acquainted with Colin, responded to the “weird” comments about him on Twitter.</p><p>I’ve known Ayo’s boyfriend for nearly a decade, and he is such a good, bright, humorous guy, so I don’t see why you guys are acting so strange. He tweeted, “Please log off and go make some real-life friends,” but afterwards erased the message.</p><p><strong>Take a look at the below tweet posted by fans:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Ayo edebiri‘s boyfriend is cute lol ppl are overreacting</p><p>— ☆FLYGIRRL (@PinkPantheresee) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 19, 2023</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Ayo Edebiri having a boyfriend means nothing to me.

(@jadeclaymores) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 18, 2023</a></p><p><strong>Take a look at the below post in which we have covered boyfriend details of other celebrities:</strong></p><h2>Is Ayo Edebiri Dating Someone on the Show?</h2><p>Only in “The Bear,” the TV show in which Ayo Edebiri appears as Sydney, does she have a partner. Actor Jeremy Allan White, who plays Chef Carmy, is her on-screen love interest. The show’s creators didn’t want to introduce love tensions between the two main characters at first.</p><p>She said in an interview that neither she nor White had given the idea much thought during production. But she said it was fun to see a different type of connection played out on TV. She also mentioned that it was nice to see a platonic connection between two men and two women on screen for a change.</p><p>Edebiri’s fans adore him for his charming humor and quick wit, which makes for fun interactions on social media. One supporter has even expressed a desire to be Ayo Edebiri’s “first Black boyfriend,” while another has noted the positive impact the comic has had on their significant other’s comedic sensibilities.</p><p>To know details relating to celebrities’ relationships and love life you can join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgbnxzfI6asKhllZmyo7XRomSbp6mbv6qxzZ1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brad-abramenko-actor-who-plays-supermans-body-double-in-peacemaker.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brad Abramenko -Actor Who Plays Supermans Body Double In Peacemaker</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-cfmoto-450-ss-price-engine-performance-top-speed-0-60-mph-specs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>2023 CFMOTO 450 SS Price, Engine, Performance, Top Speed, 0-60Mph&amp;amp;Specs. - 21Motoring</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amani-toomer.html>Amani Toomer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./giovanni-reyna.html>Giovanni Reyna</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-bentlee-sanders-being-on-the-mid-season-all-american-team-is-going-to-kickstart-his-season-with-confidence.html>How Bentlee Sanders being on the Mid-Season All American team is going to kickstart his season with</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Kyrie - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dejah-lanay.html>Dejah Lanay- Age, Net Worth, Height, Boyfriend, Career, Ethnicity</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
