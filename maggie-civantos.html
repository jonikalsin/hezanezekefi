Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Her <strong>net worth</strong> is believed to be more than $4 million as of 2022.</p><h2><span id=Maggie_Civantos-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Maggie Civantos- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Maggie was reared in Malaga by her father, a sound technician, and her mother, a singer; as an only child, she was allowed to do things that other children were not; she has claimed in an interview that she had ‘two good policemen’ instead of one stern and one careless parent.</p><p>The daughter’s parents called her Maggie Gioberti after the Maggie Gioberti character in the TV series “Falcon Crest,” of which they are avid admirers.</p><p>Maggie attended a high school in Malaga, where she first became interested in acting. Although her father encouraged her to enroll in a music school in the hopes that she would become a musician like him, she finally joined her school’s theatrical club and began taking acting lessons.

Her most recent appearances were in “Malaka” in 2019 and “Vis a Vis: El Oasis,” which will be published in 2020.

She enjoys the American film business, and her favorite actors and actresses are Robert Downey, Jr. and Katherine Hepburn, respectively, and her favorite films are “When Harry Met Sally,” “Groundhog Day,” and “Lost in Translation.”</p><p>Maggie enjoys working out in her own time and goes to the gym several times a week, but her fitness schedule is dictated by the characters she plays in movies and TV shows — she has to stop coming to the gym and eat more if her role is intended to weigh more than she does.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Maggie has <strong>5ft 4ins (1.62m)</strong> tall with long brown hair and brown eyes, weighs roughly <strong>125lbs (57kgs)</strong>, and has long brown hair and brown eyes.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Giacomo Raspadori</a>, <a href=#>Ivan Rakitic</a>, and <a href=#>Ysabelle Wallace</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Annie Chong</a></h3>Annie Chong estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
