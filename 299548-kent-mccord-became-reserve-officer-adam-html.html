After doing stunts, bits, and extra work, McCord signed a contract with Universal. After he appeared as a police officer in "Dragnet 1967," Jack Webb would cast McCord in "Adam-12," arguably his biggest role to this day. Speaking about what made the show great, McCord <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.boomermagazine.com/kent-mccord-of-adam-12-on-his-career/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>“The charm of ‘Adam-12’ was its simplicity.

The writers returned to writing each episode depicting a day in the life of the two characters.
