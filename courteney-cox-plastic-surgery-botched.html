She <a href=# rel=noopener>stated,</a></p><p><strong>Thinking I was getting older when I was really young, that's just a bummer, a waste of ti. meIt's a domino effect, it's like you don't realize that you look a little off, so then you keep doing more 'cause you look normal to yourself. You look in the mirror and go, 'Oh, that looks good,' and you don't realize what it looks like to the outside.</strong></p><p>The Scream actress even admitted to hosts <strong>Kirbie Johnson</strong> and <strong>Sara Tan Christensen</strong> that she had too many fillers injected. At that moment she expressed,</p><p><strong>Thank god they are removable. I think I messed up a lot and now, luckily, I was able to reverse most of that. Now, I'm actually just older."

She <a href=# rel=noopener>stated</a>,</p><p><strong>I didn't realize that, oh s--t, I'm actually looking really strange with injections and doing stuff to my face that I would never do now. There was a period where I went, 'I've got to stop. That's just crazy.'</strong></p><p>Furthermore, she noted that she gained a new sense of confidence back in 2017 after getting her fillers dissolved. Later, she shared with NewBeauty, <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a>, "I feel better because I look like myself. I think that I now look more like the person that I was.
