The businessman's stepson said his family wanted him to attend the event.</p><p class=fh>Hamish Harding, 58, was one of five people who went missing after going on a submarine to explore the wreck of the Titanic ship on June 18, 2023. While search and rescue efforts continue, his stepson revealed he'd gone out to enjoy a concert.</p><p class=fh>Brian Szasz, the British billionaire explorer's stepson, shared on social media how he hoped the businessman could be found safely. Harding was the chairman of Action Aviation, a private plane company.</p><p class=fh>On June 19, 2023, Szasz <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/stepson-missing-hamish-harding-attends-30284622>sent</a> his "thoughts and prayers" for a good outcome in the mission to find his stepfather. Minutes after sharing his concern about <a class="Ed a" href=#>the billionaire</a>, the 37-year-old man shared a Facebook picture of himself smiling in front of the merchandise section at a Blink-182 concert.</p><p class=fh>In the post's caption, he <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/stepson-missing-hamish-harding-attends-30284622>noted</a> how the post might seem "distasteful." However, he explained that his family would want him to attend the show. He shared how Blink-182 was his favorite band and <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/stepson-missing-hamish-harding-attends-30284622>added</a>:</p><p class=fh>"Music helps me in difficult times!"</p><p class=fh>It's been reported that the billionaire and other people were 12,000 feet below the North Atlantic Ocean.

On June 20, 2023, the audio engineer shared a follow-up post in his Instagram Stories addressing the negativity he was getting from attending the concert.</p><p class=fh>The San Diego-based man <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/1377741/titanic-sub-missing-billionaire-passengers-stepson-defends-attending-blink-182-show-during-search>asked</a> if he was supposed to "sit at home," watching the news instead of going out.
