They just loved each other so much,” Margaret said.</p><p>She and her sister also wrote a letter to Jim Hardin. In the letter, they wrote, “We are horrified by your choice of action and utter disregard for the deceased. We want to convey our feelings of distress in this matter. We merely ask for your respect… However, seeing that you have no compassion for the memory of our mother, we reluctantly agree to consent in regards to your request to exhume our mother’s body. The pain and anguish that you are causing our father and us are beyond comprehension because even you know it is a futile cause …. Even so, you may proceed in the desecration of our mother’s grave.”</p><p>“I know my father. I know he is innocent in both cases. Obviously, I wasn’t in Durham at the time, but I’ve lived with my father all my life. There’s no motive. There’s no weapon. They don’t have anything.” Margaret said while defending her father Michael.</p><h3><strong>Margaret Ratliff Biological Father</strong></h3><p>Margaret Ratcliff’s biological father was Captain George Ernest Ratcliff.
