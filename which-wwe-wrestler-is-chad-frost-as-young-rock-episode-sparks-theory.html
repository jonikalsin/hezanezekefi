There is one existing theory, and it is challenging to deny it. Have a look:</p><p>During the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was the most exciting and entertaining wrestler the WWE had to offer.</p><p>Johnson will undoubtedly be remembered by the younger generation not for his ring persona but rather for his standing as a Hollywood movie star with a multi-billion dollar profit.</p><h2><strong>Which WWE wrestler is Chad Frost as Young Rock episode sparks theories&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Johnson has led a remarkable life, so it is only acceptable that the NBC television programme Young Rock will portray his journey.</p><p>Rocky’s early years are followed in the NBC series, as well as his rapid ascent inside the WWE. The Rock remembers his battles leading up to SummerSlam 1998 and an adversary he called “Chad Frost” in the most recent episode, “Going Heavy.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The Rock is the main attraction of the Nation of Domination at the time, but behind the scenes, Chad Frost, who is portrayed as a black man with all-denim clothing and a ponytail, is trash-talking Rock to Vince McMahon.</p><p>The Rock continues by stating that Chad Frost was second only to Stone Cold as one of the top WWE talents at the time. Then Johnson explains through narration that Frost is a fictional character based on a real-life wrestler who was ruining Rock’s career at the time.</p><p>Johnson, however, never reveals the wrestler’s true name, saying:</p><p>That guy never turned out to be a friend. And I’ll just leave it there.”</p><h4>Who is the WWE wrestler that Chad Frost is referencing? Fans recognise one distinct star</h4><p>Naturally, fans have speculated about which WWE star Chad Frost is meant to represent, and one indication stands out.</p><p>Numerous followers of professional wrestling have come to the opinion that Chad Frost is very obviously meant to resemble Shawn Michaels, also known as the Heartbreak Kid. In the 1990s, Michaels was one of the most prominent and well-liked performers in the WWE.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chad frost is Shawn Michaels y'all <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">#youngrock</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">pic.twitter.com/irvj1f5Eni</a></p><p>— LouBands (@lou_bands21) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">January 14, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>For those that need to know, "Chad Frost" in <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">#YoungRock</a> is Shawn Michaels. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">@BretHart</a> & <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">@IAmJericho</a> have both confirmed that Shawn tried to bully & bury <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">@TheRock</a>… to no avail.
