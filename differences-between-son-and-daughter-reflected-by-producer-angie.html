The woman who sings with a deep, beautiful voice has had numerous relationships in the past and was once married. The native of South Carolina has also made headlines due to her preference for treating her son over her daughter.</strong></p><h2><span id=Angie_Stone-_Relationship_Married_Life>Angie Stone- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>Her music and singing haven’t always propelled her into the spotlight. The media has covered her marital situation and her extramarital relationships extensively.</p><p>In the 1980s, the music producer wed Lil’ Rodney Cee, a vocalist. In 1984, Angie Stone and her husband welcomed a daughter named Diamond. The couple’s marriage, however, did not endure long, and in the 1990s, the husband and wife split up.</p><p>And the mid-90s media frenzy was caused by the ten-time Grammy nominee’s relationship with neo-soul singer D’Angelo. D’Angelo, one of the most promising musicians at the time, became the media’s favorite couple when he fell in love with a woman who was 13 years older than him. They were Beyonce and Jay Z of the 1990s.</p><p>Long before D’Angelo had made the media’s radar, the couple had been dating. He was only 19 at the time, and Angie continued to be his rock while also braiding his short hair for his debut record. It turns out that the four years of dating resulted in the couple having a son together, Michael D’Angelo, who was born on February 28, 1997.</p><p>However, the Celebrity Fit Club star’s type II diabetes diagnosis and weight management issues in 1999 caused her to file for divorce from D’Angelo. The singer of No More Rain experienced a period without romantic relationships before beginning 2009 with a new love. She admitted to dating Ashanti, an airport employee; they got engaged in December 2009. Speaking to Essence magazine in 2009, she described her fiancé as the ideal partner for her and claimed that God had sent him to her as a gift.</p><p><strong>About her fiancé, she said:</strong></p><p>“When we first met, we just hugged and I immediately knew he was the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.<br>He works as an auditor for an airline, is a great dad to his two kids, is my greatest friend, and is a good man.”</p><p>The singer went so far as to say that they had already made up their minds that they will get married in Atlantis in the Bahamas. However, their romance ended in 2014 after she accused her manager/fiance of having an extramarital affair with an R&B Divas: Atlanta crew member.</p><p>She split up with the man she had planned to call her husband as a result of the charges. Not only has her romantic life drawn media attention to her, but so has her connection with her daughter Diamond.</p><h2><span id=Comparison_of_Son_and_Daughter_Relationships>Comparison of Son and Daughter Relationships</span></h2><p>In March 2015, Angie Stone, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, with her kid, got into a heated argument with Diamond, her child from her ex-husband Lil’ Rodney Cee. After a disagreement, the actress allegedly hit her daughter Diamond with metal jewelry, knocking out the two front teeth in the process.</p><p>She was taken into custody on an assault charge after the police were called to the scene. The actress claimed in her statement that she hit her daughter out of self-defense after they got into a full-fledged altercation before her son interfered.</p><p>A day after her arrest, the singer was freed after posting bail, and the case was ultimately dismissed in April 2016. Angie had apologized for her behavior toward her daughter earlier that year, in January 2016, via Twitter. She praised the followers on that exact tweet for their unwavering support during the difficult times. The seasoned singer insisted that she would always adore her kid no matter what had occurred between them.</p><p>The listeners may already be aware that Diamond loves to sing, just like her mother. Even more intriguing is the choice she made to dabble in R&B, a style that is closely associated with Angie.</p><p>Angie and her son Michael never got along, despite Angie having a history of bad blood with her daughter. The Wish I Didn’t Miss You singer shared a sweet photo of herself and her son on Twitter in 2016, a year after her aggravated assault arrest. She wrote that time had flown by and her son had outgrown her.</p><p>The mother of two is well known for being close to her son and is giving him all the help he needs to start a profession. Angie sang at the Musical Tribute Saluting Aretha Franklin on August 30, 2018, at Chene Park Amphitheater in Detroit, in addition to supporting her son in his career.</p><p>She was joined on stage by Dee Dee Bridgewater, KiKi Sheard, Eddie Franklin, Jhonny Gill, and a few other celebrities.</p><h2><span id=Major_Return_in_2019>Major Return in 2019</span></h2><p>Angie Stone maintained momentum for her next major release well into 2019 after having a tremendous 2018. She released a song called Dinosaur in March of that year to quell the ever-increasing demand of her music-hungry admirers. She calls her boyfriend to do the same by singing in the song about trying to look past the ghosts of her past.</p><p>Additionally, she started a national tour in 2019 that was quickly followed by her travels to Europe. The latter trip includes stops in nations like Belgium, the UK, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Angie will perform at the Happy Days Festival on May 25 and 26, 2019, according to the schedule.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Maxwell Bradley Garrett</a>, <a href=#>Ceren Alkac</a>, and <a href=#>Camaron Engel</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Singer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Aris Hampers</a></h3>Aris Hampers was a radio personality, singer, and well-known American personality.
