It can't happen again.</p><p>"I gave my son his instructions and he chose to follow a different (path)… but he can't override his dad. Because his dad is speaking sense and who will back me up? The public.</p><p>"When they understand: I lost a son, Michael Watson happened, Gerald McClellan happened, Nick Blackwell happened, and the many warriors who have fallen or are disabled because of contests in the ring.</p><p>"You cannot come down in weight, especially against a fighter of the magnitude of Mr King, Conor Benn.

I have to believe in myself.</p><p>“I’m not saying he doesn’t believe in me or believe that I’m going to do it but he’s saying it’s a danger. He probably is right. It is a danger but I’m a dangerous man.”</p><p>He added: “It’s upsetting and sad that he may have those thoughts going through his head, but that’s him.</p><p>“As a man I’ve got to do what I’ve got to do to win and to be able to perform at my best mentally."</p><p>But Eubank Sr has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled down</a> and called for people from the boxing world to boycott the fight.</p><p>Spencer Fearon revealed on his podcast a statement from the boxing legend: “This is what Eubank has said, this is Eubank’s statement, it’s a very simple statement.</p><p>“He said, ‘Dear Spencer, boycott the fight.
