The show, which began airing in 2010 on The History Channel, follows Wolfe and co-host Frank Fritz as they search for antiques in shops, sheds, barns, and garage sales across the country.</p><p>As of this writing, “American Pickers” has aired over 300 episodes across 22 seasons, making it one of the most popular shows on The History Channel. Wolfe not only co-hosts the show but also created it and serves as an executive producer.</p><p>Wolfe has also had other ventures, including an endorsement deal with Indian Motorcycles and creating a sitcom that was purchased by CBS. In 2018, he guest-starred on “NCIS” as himself. Additionally, Wolfe has published two books: “American Pickers Guide to Picking” in 2011 and “Kid Pickers: How to Turn Junk into Treasure” in 2013.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_of_Mike_Wolfe>Early Life of Mike Wolfe</span></h2><p>Mike Wolfe was born on June 11, 1964, in Joliet, Illinois. He grew up with his siblings, Beth and Robbie, in Bettendorf, Iowa, where he started picking at a young age. He would take old bikes out of a neighbor’s trash and began checking alleyways and abandoned houses for items to sell.</p><p>Wolfe attended Sudlow Intermediate School, where he met Frank Fritz, his future co-host on “American Pickers.” He graduated from Bettendorf High School in 1982.</p><h2><span id=Mike_Wolfe_From_Antique_Bikes_to_American_Pickers>Mike Wolfe: From Antique Bikes to “American Pickers”</span></h2><p>Mike Wolfe has been fascinated with antiques and hidden treasures since he was a young child. This passion led him to a career in competitive racing and the opening of his own bike shop, The Village Bike Shop. He began actively seeking out vintage bikes and other vintage finds and eventually opened Antique Archeology in Le Claire, Iowa, in 2000, and a second location in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2011.</p><p>Wolfe’s reputation for finding hidden gems brought him to the attention of The History Channel, and his show “American Pickers” premiered in 2010, attracting more than three million viewers. According to the show’s official website, Wolfe “looks for things with a story; things that fill in some of the blanks in the everyday history of America.”</p><p>Aside from his work on “American Pickers,” Mike also launched Two Lanes, a line of American-made apparel and accessories, and owns Two Lanes Guesthouse, a rental property in Columbia, Tennessee. Two Lanes Guesthouse sits above Trek Bicycle Shop, which Wolfe also owns.</p><h2><span id=Family_and_Philanthropy>Family and Philanthropy</span></h2><p>Mike Wolfe welcomed a daughter, Charlie, with Jodi Faeth on January 30, 2012, and married Jodi on September 8, 2012, after 18 years of dating. Charlie was born with a cleft palette and underwent two surgeries to correct the condition before her first birthday. This experience inspired Wolfe and Faeth to become ambassadors for Operation Smile.</p><p>In December 2013, Jodi was diagnosed with stage 2 Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. However, in May 2020, Mike shared on Instagram that Faeth had been six years cancer-free.</p><h2><span id=Mike_Wolfes_Leipers_Fork_Home>Mike Wolfe’s Leiper’s Fork Home</span></h2><p>In 2012, Mike Wolfe bought a 5,100 sq. ft. home in Leiper’s Fork, Franklin, Tennessee.

He was particularly drawn to the basement, which has barn doors and is the perfect place to store his collection of 40 motorcycles.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC5yKScZq%2BfobOmec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./trey-mcbride-contract-salary-and-net-worth-explored.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Trey McBride contract, salary and net worth explored</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-davis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Davis</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amani-toomer.html>Amani Toomer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./giovanni-reyna.html>Giovanni Reyna</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-bentlee-sanders-being-on-the-mid-season-all-american-team-is-going-to-kickstart-his-season-with-confidence.html>How Bentlee Sanders being on the Mid-Season All American team is going to kickstart his season with</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Kyrie - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dejah-lanay.html>Dejah Lanay- Age, Net Worth, Height, Boyfriend, Career, Ethnicity</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ChirpBlog.
